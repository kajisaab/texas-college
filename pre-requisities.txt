🧠 1. PEP 8 – Python Enhancement Proposal 8

🔹 What it is:
The official style guide for writing Python code — basically, the “grammar rules” for Python.

🔹 What it defines:
Rules for how your code should look:
	•	Indentation: 4 spaces per level
	•	Line length: max 79 characters
	•	Naming conventions (e.g. snake_case for functions/variables)
	•	Blank lines between functions/classes
	•	Spaces around operators
	•	Import order and formatting

🔹 Why it matters:
It makes your code more readable, standardized, and easier to collaborate on.

# Not PEP 8 compliant
def  add(a,b):return a+b

# PEP 8 compliant
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


2. isort – Import Sorter

🔹 What it does:
Automatically sorts your imports to follow PEP 8 guidelines.

🔹 Why it’s useful:
Keeps import statements clean, alphabetical, grouped, and avoids duplicates.


3. black – The Uncompromising Code Formatter

🔹 What it does:
Automatically reformats your entire code file to follow a consistent, opinionated style.

🔹 Why it’s popular:
	•	One standard way to format code — no arguments.
	•	Fast and works with most editors (like VS Code).
	•	Follows PEP 8 with some stricter rules (e.g. 88 char line limit instead of 79).
